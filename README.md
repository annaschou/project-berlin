# Data Project Assignment 2

The aim of this project was to analyze how Berlin treats non-citizens by mapping where they live and the conditions they face – from cramped housing to air pollution and noise. The focus was on illustrating social and environmental inequalities through maps, highlighting how dual citizenship and migration patterns shape the city.

My personal goal was to improve my GIS and data visualization skills, as well as my ability to communicate complex spatial data effectively.

## Data Collection

The data for this project was collected from a open data source. Key datasets included:
- Population data: across Berlin districts.
- Environmental data: Air quality, noise, and green space availability
- Social data: Indicators like the status index, which measures social and economic conditions.

This is the source for my data:
- Berlin Open Data Portal

## Data Analysis

The data was analyzed using QGIS, with a focus on spatial analysis techniques. Key steps included:

- Importing and processing WFS (Web Feature Service) data.
- Analyzing spatial patterns of non-citizen populations and their overlap with environmental and social challenges.
- Creating visualizations to highlight disparities in housing, air quality, and noise levels.

This was my first time working extensively with QGIS, and I learned how to find, import, and analyze WFS data. While I successfully analyzed the data, I spent so much time on data collection and processing that I was unable to refine the maps in Illustrator as originally planned.

## Key Findings
The analysis revealed stark patterns of inequality in Berlin:

- East-West Divide: Non-citizens are concentrated in western districts like Neukölln and Mitte, while eastern districts like Marzahn-Hellersdorf and Treptow-Köpenick have far fewer non-citizen residents.
- Overcrowding: In areas like Neukölln, residents have less living space per person
- Environmental Burdens: Non-citizens are more likely to live in areas with poor air quality, high noise levels, and limited green spaces, especially in neighborhoods with heavy traffic and dense housing.

## Skills Learned
This project allowed me to develop and refine several technical skills:

- QGIS: Learning how to use geospatial tools for data analysis and visualization.
- WFS Data: Finding, importing, and processing Web Feature Service datasets.
- Spatial Analysis: Identifying and illustrating patterns of inequality through maps.

## Challenges and Things I Would've Liked to Do
While the analysis was insightful, there were areas left unexplored due to time constraints:

- Refining Visualizations: I had planned to export the maps to Illustrator for further refinement, but I ran out of time due to the complexity of data collection and analysis.
- Expanding the Scope: Including additional datasets, such as migration trends over time or comparisons with other 
German cities, could have provided a broader context. Also I wanted to include data before the fall of the Berlin Wall but I have not found any data. 
- Scrollytelling: I tried to do a scrollytellig page but also here I ran out of tmie.

Originally, I had planned to create a map-based analysis of "anxiety spaces" in Berlin, but this project evolved into a broader exploration of social and environmental inequalities faced by non-citizens. Despite the challenges, I gained valuable experience in GIS and spatial data analysis, which will inform my future work.
